# shop-management
 In this project, I have been focused on the shop management system. In  this real-life project, I added some more necessary tables 
 for this project and I used here store procedure, constraint, primary key, foreign key, and more. Store procedure makes database fast. I created this Database by using every 
 important subject in the MS SQL server.
 This is an example of all the necessary items for a database.
